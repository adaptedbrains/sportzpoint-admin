This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install  # Fastest option
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev     # Fastest option
```

### Using Bun (Optional)

This project supports [Bun](https://bun.sh) as an optional, faster alternative to Node.js.

#### Installation

##### On macOS or Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

##### On Windows:
1. First, install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
   ```powershell
   # Run in PowerShell as Administrator
   wsl --install
   ```
   After installation, restart your computer.

2. Install Bun in WSL:
   ```bash
   # Open WSL terminal and run:
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

3. For the best experience on Windows:
   - Install VSCode with the "Remote - WSL" extension
   - Open your project folder in WSL: `code .`
   - Run all Bun commands in the WSL terminal

#### Using Bun

##### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start development server
bun dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Start production server
bun run start
```

##### On Windows (via WSL):
```bash
# Install dependencies
wsl bun install

# Start development server
wsl bun dev

# Build for production
wsl bun run build

# Start production server
wsl bun run start
```

#### Troubleshooting on Windows

1. If WSL is not installed:
   ```powershell
   # Run in PowerShell as Administrator
   wsl --install
   ```

2. If you need to update WSL:
   ```powershell
   wsl --update
   ```

3. Common issues:
   - If Bun commands aren't working, make sure you're running them in a WSL terminal
   - If you can't access the development server, check that port forwarding is enabled in WSL
   - For VSCode integration, install the "Remote - WSL" extension and use the WSL terminal

Bun provides faster installation and development server startup times compared to Node.js. However, using Node.js (npm, yarn, or pnpm) remains fully supported.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
